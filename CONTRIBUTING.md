# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

NOTE: If you are new to GitHub, please start by reading the [Pull Request
howto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Coding Style

To keep the source consistent, readable, diffable and easy to merge, we use a
fairly rigid coding style, as defined by the
[google-styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) project. All patches
will be expected to conform to the Python style outlined
[here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

## Guidelines for Pull Requests

*   Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single
    concern**. We often receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at a
    time, but if only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and
    both author's & review's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address
    different concerns and everyone will be happy.

*   For speculative changes, consider opening an
